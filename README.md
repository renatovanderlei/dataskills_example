In this document, I demonstrate how I am using R programming language to run some statistical analysis on the differences in some aspects of forest structure and trees taxonomic composition between different habitats following swidden agriculture.
I use a set of packages to import, organize, transform, calculate and display the information I need in order to answer these two scientific questions.

Here, I am going to focus on 2 main questions:
1 - How the total aboveground basal area, basal area of primary roots (i.e., belowground) and number of primary roots change among the different habitats?
2 - How the taxonomic composition (i.e., set of species) change between habitats?

I use three datasets to answer the questions.
